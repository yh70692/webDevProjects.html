# üåêWeb Development Projects

I had never used VS Code as my primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) due to my initial exposure to Atom. However, when it came to the end of it lifeline, I finally succumbed to its use. Designing the front-end of a website has proven to be an incredibly relaxing experience for me. Design and art are my preferred forms of expression, and I'm thrilled to integrate them into my coding work.

On the other hand, working on the backend is more in line with my overall development experience. It's been an educational journey, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this field.

## üìùThe types of projects that would be included in this section are:

- Testing: This category would encompass projects where you experimented with different technologies, methods, or ideas to assess their feasibility or functionality. It might include prototypes, proof-of-concept projects, or experiments to test various concepts.

- Works in Progress: This would showcase ongoing projects that are still in development. These could be projects that are not yet completed but are actively being worked on. It's a way to demonstrate my commitment to continuous improvement and development.

- Forgotten Failures: In this category, I might document projects that didn't go as planned or were ultimately abandoned. While these projects may not have succeeded in their original goals, they can still provide valuable insights into my learning process and demonstrate my ability to adapt and learn from setbacks.
